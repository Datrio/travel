My last weeks in Berlin were just like the rest of my time here—chaotic and ever-changing. Originally, I planned to start my trip on January 1st, but at the end of December, I got COVID. It was a mild case, but it threw a wrench into my plans. Though I wasn't thrilled about the delay, I felt a small relief—more time to prepare. I reset the start date for January 22nd, a Wednesday. On that Wednesday, as I boarded the train, I could safely say, "What a week, huh?"

One of my friends, Nicolas Bouliane, has an amazing blog, All About Berlin, where he touches on topics like moving out. If you ever need help navigating life in Berlin, I highly recommend it. Nicolas was an invaluable resource, helping me ensure I didn't overlook anything. Another key figure was Brian from TaskRabbit, who came over for two days to help me with everything from covering holes in walls and painting them over to disassembling furniture and driving me to the recycling center. He even helped with the final deep clean of my flat.

Once I decided to leave, I had three options for my flat and belongings:
1. Sublet my flat with everything inside.
2. Give up the flat and store all my things.
3. Give up the flat and sell everything.

Berlin has great laws protecting renters from skyrocketing rents, but unfortunately, my flat, being in a Neubau, wasn’t covered. Over four years, my rent increased by about 32%, and it would likely continue to rise. I knew I didn’t want to move back into this flat, so subletting was off the table.

Storing my belongings was another option, but I owned far too much. While I initially aimed for minimalism, my second flat became a cozy haven filled with carefully chosen furniture, 70 Lego sets, a custom kitchen island, a working corner, and a relaxing balcony setup. Storing all this would cost at least €150 per month—money better spent on travel. Ultimately, I decided to sell almost everything through Kleinanzeigen and other means.

Selling everything wasn’t as daunting as it seemed, thanks to friends who kindly offered to store a few sentimental items. Their support made the process feel less overwhelming. With that, I sorted my belongings into three categories: sell, donate/give away, and keep. This Marie Kondo-esque exercise was unexpectedly transformative. Initially, the thought of parting with so many things felt overwhelming. But as I sorted, I reflected on each item’s purpose and realized letting go wasn’t about losing—it was about creating space for new experiences.

Here’s how it broke down:
- **Lego Sets**: Most went out—they took up space and gathered dust. However, I kept a few rare and nostalgic sets.
- **Gaming Gear**: My consoles went, as I can replace them later. Unique games, like original Final Fantasy releases from Japan, stayed.
- **Clothes**: Most of my wardrobe (shirts, jeans, sweaters) was donated. Only travel clothes and a few unique pieces, like my green leaf hoodie, made the cut.
- **Kitchen Equipment**: I loved cooking, but it was all sold or donated. I can always get it back once I come back.
- **Furniture**: Selling on Kleinanzeigen was frustrating—many buyers ghosted or backed out. I eventually gave away most pieces for free, even throwing out my table when no one wanted it.
- **Sentimental Items**: A small bag of cherished memories—photos, letters, mementos—was carefully packed away.

In the end, I raised €10,000, about half of my travel budget. More importantly, selling everything gave me an incredible sense of freedom. With each item sold, my excitement grew. I felt lighter, unburdened, and ready for what lay ahead.

Likewise, saying goodbye to friends and favorite places was an emotional rollercoaster. I revisited beloved restaurants and bars, reliving countless shared meals and laughs. Retracing my first walk through Berlin’s streets reminded me of the moment I thought, "I could belong here." Sitting one last time in the park where I decided to settle in Berlin brought a wave of gratitude for all this city had given me.

While bittersweet, these farewells also filled me with love. My therapist asked if I was sad to leave my friends. As Goku said in Dragon Ball, "Yeah, but they aren’t going anywhere, and if they do, they’ll probably be going back to me." That sentiment captured it perfectly. Each goodbye left me feeling deeply valued and supported.

Leaving Berlin has been one of the most intense chapters of my life. It wasn’t just about packing up and moving on; it was about letting go of the material, cherishing the emotional, and embracing the unknown. Berlin, its people, and its experiences have shaped me for the past 15 years, and I’ll carry pieces of it with me as I move forward.

For now, the world awaits, and I’m ready to embrace it—one step, one story, and one adventure at a time.
